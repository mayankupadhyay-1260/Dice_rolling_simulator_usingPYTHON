# Dice Rolling Simulator README

## Overview
The Dice Rolling Simulator is a simple Python application that simulates the rolling of dice. It generates random numbers representing the outcome of the dice rolls and displays the corresponding ASCII art representation of the dice. The application is designed to be user-friendly and can be easily extended with additional features.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `random`: For generating random numbers to simulate dice rolls.
  - `timeit`: For measuring the execution time of the program (optional).
- **File Handling**: The application writes the results to a text file (`result.txt`).

## Features
The current implementation includes the following features:
- User input for the number of dice to roll.
- Random generation of dice values between 1 and 6.
- Calculation of the total value of all rolled dice.
- Display of ASCII art for each rolled die.
- Output of results to a text file.

### Possible Features to Add
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Implement a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a more interactive experience.

2. **Custom Dice**:
   - Allow users to define custom dice with different numbers of sides (e.g., 4-sided, 8-sided, etc.).

3. **Multiple Rolls**:
   - Enable users to roll multiple sets of dice at once and compare results.

4. **Statistics**:
   - Provide statistical analysis of the rolls, such as average, minimum, maximum, and frequency of each number rolled.

5. **History of Rolls**:
   - Maintain a history of previous rolls and display them to the user.

6. **Save and Load Configurations**:
   - Allow users to save their settings (number of dice, type of dice) and load them in future sessions.

7. **Animations**:
   - Add animations for rolling dice to enhance user experience.

8. **Sound Effects**:
   - Incorporate sound effects for rolling dice and displaying results.

9. **Mobile Compatibility**:
   - Develop a mobile version of the application for use on smartphones and tablets.

10. **Online Multiplayer**:
    - Create an online multiplayer feature where users can roll dice together in real-time.

## Usage
1. Run the script `dice_rolling_backend.py`.
2. Enter the number of dice you want to roll when prompted.
3. The total of the rolled dice will be displayed along with their ASCII art representation.
4. The results will be saved in `result.txt`.

## Conclusion
The Dice Rolling Simulator is a fun and educational project that demonstrates basic programming concepts in Python. With the suggested features, it can be expanded into a more comprehensive tool for dice games and simulations.
